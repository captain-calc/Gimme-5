# Gimme 5: All Stars

Gimme 5: All Stars is a remake of the original Gimme5 word-guessing game, which was inspired by the popular Web-game, Wordle. In this game, the player has five chances to guess a five-letter English word by entering other five-letter English words. Letters in the player's guess that appear in the target word will be color-coded, helping the player decide which word to guess next.

Unlike the original Wordle, Gimme 5: All Stars has a larger dictionary (4,000+ words), and the user can play as many games as they like each day.

Gimme 5! All Stars also keeps the original Gimme5's "Word Code" feature, a 12-character sequence that represents an encrypted dictionary word. These codes can be entered into the program from the main menu and allow the player to start a new game with that word. This feature allows the player to share codes of words they have played with friends and family, adding an additional layer of challenge or co-operation play.

Word codes from the original Gimme5 program should be compatible with Gimme 5: All Stars, and vice versa. However, updated releases of this program may change the dictionary, so compatibility is not guaranteed.
